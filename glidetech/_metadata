  "description" : "Adds a new end-game Tech based on the Multi Jump, which allows you to glide and AVOID fall damage while pressing space. The longer you glide, the faster you go;  if you change direction, you loose speed. \n\nDetails:\n- 1 new quest in the outpost to make the Tech available (only bringing some ores, like previous quests).\n- Holding space makes you fall slower and avoid fall damage.\n- Speed increasing at 3.5/s while you glide in the same direction.\n- 25% speed lost when you change direction.\n- There's only Multi Jump variant. Not any other leg Tech.\n- 5% higher jump height. \n\nMade it a whole new Tech to avoid compatibility issues. Should work with most other Tech mods but won't be affected by them or mods which change Multi Jump mechanics.\n\nIt's my first mod so I did something that I found useful and not too overpowered, may be a little underwhelming but it can be extremely useful, that's why I consider it end-game gear and requires a decent amount of resources to get.\n\nAny issue please let me know, \n  have fun!",
